The machines, which you see from level 3, allow you to control diverse parts of the game's environment.

#### Door Block
When fired, the door block will swing open and close all doors on the the map. (Like a door should :)

#### Fence Block
When fired, the fence block will destroy and annihilate all destroy all fences on the map. KABOOM

#### Vertical and Horizontal Conditional Block
Conditional blocks will break the chain if the condition isn't respected. For the vertical one, you need to be right of the block for it to break the chain. As for the horizontal one, you need to be below it to stop the chain.

#### Launch Blocks
The launch blocks are the one launching chains. There are in total 4 different launch blocks, unlocked at different stages of the game. The repeated launch block will fire every second, the fast repeat launch block will fire every frame, the normal launch block will launch on a space bar click, and the last one, the close normal launch block will fire on a space bar click, but only when near it.
